SIMPLE CALCULATOR

Four function definitions (add, subtract, multiply, and divide) each accept two numbers (x and y). The two numbers are evaluated and the result is returned. A user enters two numbers, one after the other, via prompt. User's prompt entries are translated to integers by eval() method and saved to variables (no1 and no2). Available operators that a user might choose from are printed. A while loop with a boolean as the condition is set to "True". Inside while loop user is prompted to pick a number correspondant to available operator choices, value of this prompt is saved to a variable "choice". Also inside the while loop a function definition number_chosen() accepts the variable "choice" as its only parameter. A switch statement is used to check the users choice against a case (range 1-5). Depending on the case an f-string is printed, including the evaluation of the values of no1 and no2 from the captured user input and the corresponding function call.
